So far I have been creating the components and creating the front end interactivity. Now, what I seek to do is make my site look prettier. Right now, the site is closer to what I would call
## Y2k core
It is a lot like the old websites that first started using CSS. They look better, but they are clunky and a little blocky. What I want to do is make my website look more modern and fit in more with the modern design sensibilities of the internet now. To do that will be testing my CSS knowledge and expand on them.
To achieve this, I first need to settle on some design guidelines. First of which is a color scheme for the website.
I am in love with a certain red color. I want to use it wile keeping the colors monochromatic. I have found a website [here](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) that helps create a color palette through a color wheel. It is helpful in generating a good palette. Beyond color, I am looking to the application Discord for the design of my website. The UI for Discord is rather enticing, so I wish to take some design elements such as the rounded navbar.
