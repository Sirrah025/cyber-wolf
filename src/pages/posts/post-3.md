So this is the third post I have made. I have focused on less web development, but came back to learn hydration. It is a feature of Astro that allows me to bring JavaScript into the page, but loading them in certain contexts. I also have been refining content collection using tags. The tags are a little buggy, and I am fixing them as I write this. And there were some typos that caused the tag pages to not render properly. But thanks to some good fixing, I was able to fix the site's problems.
