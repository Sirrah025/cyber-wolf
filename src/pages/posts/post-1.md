Welcome to the _first blog_ on my blog of coding adventures! Here, I am sharing my journey learning Astro along with a few other technologies.

## What has been accomplished
1. **Installing Astro**: The first accomplishment is creating this Astro project and setting up the online repository.
2. **Makng markdown pages**: I created the first markdown page, which you can see here, and linking to it on my site.

## What's next?

I am following the tutorial to learn the nuances and structure of Astro. From there, I plan on using it as a portfolio and showcase of coding skills. Watch this site for more to come.
